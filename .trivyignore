# Trivy ignore file
# Add CVE IDs or vulnerability IDs to ignore specific vulnerabilities
# Use this file carefully and only for accepted risks with proper justification

# Example: Ignore a specific CVE with justification
# CVE-2021-44228  # Log4j vulnerability - not applicable to our Node.js application

# Example: Ignore vulnerabilities in specific packages
# pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.20  # Lodash vulnerability - using safe functions only

# Example: Ignore vulnerabilities by severity in specific files
# Dockerfile:DKV-001  # Dockerfile security check - accepted risk for development

# Template for adding ignores:
# [CVE-ID or VULNERABILITY-ID]  # [JUSTIFICATION AND MITIGATION]

# Note: Each ignore should have:
# 1. Clear justification for why it's being ignored
# 2. Mitigation measures in place
# 3. Review date for re-evaluation
# 4. Approval from security team (if required)
